# Automatic CEFR Level Labelling Tool.

The task of text classification was chosen for this project. The aim of this project is to compare an
existing dataset of collected English-language resources against a newly collected test set. The test
set in question consists of English-language reading comprehension passages designed for language
learners. The text is to be classed by its difficulty on the Common European Framework of Reference
(CEFR). Therefore, this particular project will focus on multiclass classification, where each text can
be assigned one of the six CEFR levels, i.e. A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 or C2.

A variety of methods were tested for this project.
